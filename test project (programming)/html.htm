 <p class="sea"> This article focuses on the collective seas of Earth. For individual seas, see List of seas.

    Seas are important for human development and trade, as at Singapore, the world's busiest entrepôt.
    A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land
    More broadly, "the sea" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic waters—considered
    as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions.
    The sea moderates Earth's climate and has 
    important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle,
    and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, 
    the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—dates 
    broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally
    divided into up to five large oceanic sections—including 
    the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific,
    Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean
    smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as seas. </p>
