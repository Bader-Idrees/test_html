                Seas are important for <b id="wrap"> human </b> development and trade, as
                at Singapore, the world's busiest entrepôt.
                A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole
                or in part by land
                More broadly, "the sea" is the interconnected system of Earth's
                salty, oceanic waters—considered
                as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions.
                The sea moderates Earth's climate and has
                important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle,
                and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and
                explored since prehistory,
                the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—dates
                broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s.
                The sea is conventionally
                divided into up to five large oceanic sections—including
                the International Hydrographic Organization's four named
                oceans <sub id="wrap">(the Atlantic, Pacific,
                Indian, and Arctic)</sub> and the Southern Ocean
                smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as seas.
